## Additional features to implement:

- allow user to input team names/colors
- switch up the key
- require team selection

## Useful things to remember:

- you can access a property as a string, which means you can append and manipulate it as you would any string by using this syntax:
  `this["propertyName"]`

## Questions to follow up on:

- one of the tasks was to refactor the grid component out of the parent and into a child component. With more complicated sites and components, what can you do as you're developing to make it easier to move all of the relevant functionality. Like, there was not a great way for me to know which properties and methods belonged to the grid.
